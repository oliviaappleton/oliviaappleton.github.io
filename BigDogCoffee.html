    <p>Big Dog Coffee is located in the Southside. This is my go-to place for lattes and home-made croissants.
        I love the pretty latte art the baristas do. They are so talented! There is plenty of indoor and 
        outdoor seating so it's the perfect place to hang out, get some work done, and have maybe
        two or three double espressos while you're there . Since This shop is conveniently  located just off of East Carson Street, it is the perfect spot for Pitt students to escape too during finals.
        You can check out some of Baron Batch's paintings while you have your coffee, and then head over to the South Side works for some shopping or a movie!</p>
