    <p>Big Dog Coffee is located in the Southside. This is my go-to place for lattes and croissants 
        *heavy breathing* YOU GUYS look at this latte art. There is plenty of indoor and 
        outdoor seating so it's the perfect place to hang out, get some work done, and have maybe
        two or three double espressos while you're there . This large latte was worth every calorie.</p>
