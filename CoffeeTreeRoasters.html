<p>Coffee Tree Roasters is located in Shadyside and it uses locally roasted Pittsburgh coffee!
    They have multiple locations all around town. I usually order chai tea lattes when I go here and they are amazing. 
    An added bonus to this location is that it is right across the street from Pittsburgh's famous Prantl's Bakery! 
    What's better than a fresh baked croissant to go with your latte? Prantl's is known for their burnt almond tort, 
    which is a Pittsburgh must try. This location on Walnut Street is a short bus ride away from Pitt's campus and it is near to many shops, restaurants, and other fun things to do! Go check out Coffee Tree Roasters and Prantl's in Shadyside.</p>
