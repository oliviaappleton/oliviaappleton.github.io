<p>Coffee Tree Roasters is located in Shadyside and it uses locally roasted Pittsburgh coffee!
    They have multiple locations all around town. I usually order chai tea lattes when I go here and they are amazing. 
    An added bonus to this location is that it is right across the street from Pittsburgh's famous Prantl's Bakery! 
    What's better than a fresh baked croissant to go with your latte? Prantl's is known for their burnt almond tort, 
    which is a Pittsburgh must try. Go check out Coffee Tree Roasters and Prantl's in Shadyside </p>
