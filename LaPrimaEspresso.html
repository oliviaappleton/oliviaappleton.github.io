<p>La Prima Espresso Co. is located in Pittsburgh's Strip District. 
  This Pittsburgh favorite is a must try and is even worth the pain of parallel parking on Penn Ave. 
  The best part of stopping in here for a cup of coffee is that you have the whole strip to walk ahead of you. 
 My favorite thing to order here is a "mocha doppio". Unlike other coffee shops, La Prima does not have ample seating inside.
  This is a small negative and it doesn't really matter because there are so many other places to explore in the Stip! I always grab a coffee
  at La Prima first thing when I get to the Strip and then take it with me to shop. This is close to Penn Mac, Delucas, and Wholey's (PITTSBURGH MUST SEES).</p>
