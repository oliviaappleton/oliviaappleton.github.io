<p>La Prima Espresso Co. is located in Pittsburgh's Strip District. 
  This Pittsburgh favorite is a must try and is even worth the pain of parallel parking on Penn Ave. 
  The best part of stopping in here for a cup of coffee is that you have the whole strip to walk ahead of you. 
  Stop in to get a mocha doppio and let me know what you think! </p>
